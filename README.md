# Multiple-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch
This repository contains the implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression from scratch** using Python and NumPy, without relying on pre-built machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn. The project demonstrates how regression coefficients can be calculated manually and how the regression equation can be formed and visualized.
