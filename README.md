**Multiple Linear Regression from Scratch**



This repository contains the implementation of \*\*Multiple Linear Regression from scratch\*\* using Python and NumPy, without relying on pre-built machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn. The project demonstrates how regression coefficients can be calculated manually and how the regression equation can be formed and visualized.







&nbsp;📌 **Project Overview**

\- Implemented a custom multiple linear regression model.  

\- Generated synthetic dataset with multiple features (X1, X2, …).  

\- Calculated regression coefficients using mathematical formulas.  

\- Derived the final regression equation.  

\- Created \*\*feature-wise visualizations\*\* of regression lines using Matplotlib.  



This project was developed as part of an assignment to understand the core mathematical concepts behind linear regression.







&nbsp;📊 **Dataset**

The dataset is **synthetically generated** using NumPy.  

The target variable **Y** is created using a linear relationship with multiple features plus some random noise.



Example relationship:

&nbsp;Y = 4 + 3X + 2X1 - X2 + ε
